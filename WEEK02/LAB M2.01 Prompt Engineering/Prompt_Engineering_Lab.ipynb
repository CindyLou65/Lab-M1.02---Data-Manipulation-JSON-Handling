    "What failure patterns was identified:\n",
    "During this lab, I identified several failure patterns in the original zero-shot prompts. The most common issues were format drift, inconsistent JSON structure, and high variability in generated outputs. While sentiment classification was relatively stable, it lacked strict format control. Product descriptions showed extreme variation, and data extraction outputs were not always production-safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which techniques had the biggest impact:\n",
    "Few-shot prompting had the biggest impact on consistency, especially for sentiment classification. Adding structured output constraints significantly improved reliability across all tasks. Chain-of-Thought guidance improved reasoning quality in the extraction task and reduced variability further. Overall, combining structure with examples proved more effective than simple instruction refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would I do differently next time:\n",
    "If I were to improve this further, I would experiment with stricter token-length control for product descriptions and possibly enforce schema validation through post-processing. I would also test edge cases such as ambiguous sentiment and incomplete feedback to evaluate robustness more deeply.\n"
