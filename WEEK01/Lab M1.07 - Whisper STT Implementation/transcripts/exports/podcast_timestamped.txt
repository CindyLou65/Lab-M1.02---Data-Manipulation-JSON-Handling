[00:00:00 - 00:00:02] Hey there, I'm Asma Khalid.
[00:00:02 - 00:00:06] And I'm Tristan Redman, and we're here with a bonus episode for you from the Global
[00:00:06 - 00:00:07] Story podcast.
[00:00:07 - 00:00:09] The world order is shifting.
[00:00:09 - 00:00:13] Old alliances are fraying and new ones are emerging.
[00:00:13 - 00:00:18] Some of this turbulence can be traced to decisions made in the United States.
[00:00:18 - 00:00:21] But the US isn't just a cause of the upheaval.
[00:00:21 - 00:00:24] Its politics are also a symptom of it.
[00:00:24 - 00:00:29] Every day we focus on one story, looking at how America and the world shape each other.
[00:00:29 - 00:00:35] So we hope you enjoy this episode, and to find more of our show, just search for The
[00:00:35 - 00:00:40] Global Story wherever you get your BBC podcasts.
[00:00:40 - 00:00:45] In the past few weeks, the US military has launched a steady stream of airstrikes in
[00:00:45 - 00:00:46] Syria.
[00:00:46 - 00:00:50] US officials say they're targeting the group known as the Islamic State, ISIS.
[00:00:50 - 00:00:56] In part, it's retaliation for an attack on US forces in the region last December.
[00:00:56 - 00:01:01] After a year of war, Pete Hegseth calls new airstrikes tonight in Syria a declaration
[00:01:01 - 00:01:04] of vengeance against ISIS terrorists.
[00:01:04 - 00:01:09] The US military has struck more than 50 ISIS targets in the past two hours.
[00:01:09 - 00:01:16] We hit every site flawlessly, and we are restoring peace through strength all over the world.
[00:01:16 - 00:01:20] These strikes also come against the backdrop of a recent jailbreak in which more than a
[00:01:20 - 00:01:26] hundred militants escaped from a prison in Syria, raising fresh questions about the security
[00:01:26 - 00:01:29] and fate of ISIS detainees.
[00:01:29 - 00:01:34] And so now the US military is in the midst of transferring up to 7,000 prisoners from
[00:01:34 - 00:01:40] Syria to Iraq because of instability and infighting.
[00:01:40 - 00:01:44] From the BBC, I'm Asma Khalid in Washington, DC.
[00:01:44 - 00:01:50] And today on The Global Story, is the Islamic State group having a resurgence in Syria?
[00:01:50 - 00:01:56] Well, Josh, it's wonderful to have you on the show.
[00:01:56 - 00:01:58] I'm a big fan of your work.
[00:01:58 - 00:01:59] So thanks for joining us.
[00:01:59 - 00:02:00] I appreciate the compliment.
[00:02:00 - 00:02:02] You can send me an invoice for that later.
[00:02:02 - 00:02:06] Well, can I have you introduce yourself for those who may not be familiar with who you
[00:02:06 - 00:02:08] are and what you do?
[00:02:08 - 00:02:13] So I'm an investigative journalist, filmmaker and podcaster, and I've sort of reported
[00:02:13 - 00:02:18] on ISIS predominantly since the emergence of the group right through to present day.
[00:02:18 - 00:02:21] I was even injured by the group in a suicide bombing back in 2016.
[00:02:21 - 00:02:26] Josh, I know you have created these epic series about ISIS.
[00:02:26 - 00:02:30] You've done a lot of reporting in the last decade or so when this group was at its height
[00:02:30 - 00:02:32] in Syria and Iraq.
[00:02:32 - 00:02:36] And the reason I wanted to have you on our show today is because for the last several
[00:02:36 - 00:02:42] weeks, I have been getting these email notifications in my inbox from US Central Command talking
[00:02:42 - 00:02:46] about strikes on ISIS targets in Syria.
[00:02:46 - 00:02:50] And I had this moment of, well, wait a second, you know, what's going on here?
[00:02:50 - 00:02:54] Because President Trump, during his first term in the White House, had said that ISIS
[00:02:54 - 00:02:56] was defeated.
[00:02:56 - 00:03:02] And I want to begin with a sort of broad, big picture question, which is, why are we
[00:03:02 - 00:03:04] talking about ISIS again?
[00:03:04 - 00:03:08] So I think the thing to think about ISIS is that they disappeared from the news cycle,
[00:03:08 - 00:03:09] right?
[00:03:09 - 00:03:11] And everyone kind of forgot about them.
[00:03:11 - 00:03:14] But on the ground, they were always still there.
[00:03:14 - 00:03:18] Now, granted, that wasn't at the scale that they once was.
[00:03:18 - 00:03:19] But they never really went away.
[00:03:19 - 00:03:24] And I think, you know, I was just in Damascus, actually, very recently, and one of my last
[00:03:24 - 00:03:28] nights there, I was having this dinner with a group of Syrian friends.
[00:03:28 - 00:03:32] And while we were there, people's phones started buzzing.
[00:03:32 - 00:03:36] And that was because a suicide bombing had gone off.
[00:03:36 - 00:03:41] And at that point, I remember watching my friends' faces, and they were like, huh, the
[00:03:41 - 00:03:43] insurgency has started.
[00:03:43 - 00:03:45] And I think this is the key thing.
[00:03:45 - 00:03:50] While they disappeared from the headlines, they didn't actually disappear on the ground.
[00:03:50 - 00:03:54] Before we get any further into this conversation, I just want to pause for a moment and talk
[00:03:54 - 00:03:56] about terminology.
[00:03:56 - 00:03:58] You've heard me refer to the group here as ISIS.
[00:03:58 - 00:04:03] Some listeners may know it as IS, or the so-called Islamic State.
[00:04:03 - 00:04:07] And the terminology can be a little confusing here, because the group has been described
[00:04:07 - 00:04:09] under different names.
[00:04:09 - 00:04:16] But regardless of the name, I think it is worth rewinding to 2014.
[00:04:16 - 00:04:21] And I think that's the moment when, here in the United States, ISIS really penetrated
[00:04:21 - 00:04:23] into the public consciousness.
[00:04:23 - 00:04:27] It's the year that President Obama announced the global coalition to defeat ISIS.
[00:04:27 - 00:04:32] It was also the year that the American journalist James Foley was executed.
[00:04:32 - 00:04:36] And at that time, Josh, what was the group selling?
[00:04:36 - 00:04:40] So let's just rewind for a moment, because when we think about terrorist groups, we tend
[00:04:40 - 00:04:43] to think of small entities running around, creating havoc.
[00:04:43 - 00:04:50] And actually, what was unique about ISIS is that they actually formed a so-called state,
[00:04:50 - 00:04:53] their caliphate, as they called it, if you will.
[00:04:53 - 00:04:57] And people sometimes forget this when we talk about this group, is at the height of their
[00:04:57 - 00:05:04] power, they actually controlled an area the size of England, right, that spanned Iraq
[00:05:04 - 00:05:05] and Syria.
[00:05:05 - 00:05:09] And it had roughly 10 million people under their governance.
[00:05:09 - 00:05:16] And what they did then is they set about a really highly polished PR and propaganda campaign
[00:05:16 - 00:05:24] of selling this vision to the world of a supposed Islamic utopia, and inviting people from all
[00:05:24 - 00:05:26] around the world to come and join them.
[00:05:26 - 00:05:31] And tens of thousands of people did from more than 100 nations.
[00:05:31 - 00:05:35] And from there, the state grew and grew and grew.
[00:05:35 - 00:05:40] But a lot of people felt like this was not a representation of Islam at all.
[00:05:40 - 00:05:45] Yeah, I mean, and just to be transparent with listeners, I mean, I'm a Muslim woman, I have
[00:05:45 - 00:05:50] a master's in Middle Eastern Islamic Studies, I've studied the faith quite a bit.
[00:05:50 - 00:05:56] And what they were selling was such a distortion of the religion and seemed so disconnected
[00:05:56 - 00:06:04] from reality, that it is mind boggling to me that it was in any ways sold as a utopia.
[00:06:04 - 00:06:11] During the height of the ISIS caliphate days, Josh, I know you reported from the region.
[00:06:11 - 00:06:13] What was it like to report from the region at that time?
[00:06:13 - 00:06:20] It was an extraordinary time because you had a scenario where literally the map of
[00:06:20 - 00:06:24] two countries had been redrawn by this terrorist organisation.
[00:06:24 - 00:06:28] And you had a concerted effort to defeat them going on.
[00:06:28 - 00:06:35] So being inside the territory that they controlled, or the fight to regain that territory was
[00:06:35 - 00:06:37] extraordinarily dangerous.
[00:06:37 - 00:06:42] We're in an armoured car pulling back from one of the forward positions.
[00:06:42 - 00:06:49] The roads are literally littered with debris, with cars.
[00:06:49 - 00:06:54] I remember there was one time when I was in Iraq, I was embedded with Iraqi special forces
[00:06:54 - 00:06:59] and they were trying to retake the city of Mosul, which is where ISIS had declared its
[00:06:59 - 00:07:01] so-called caliphate from.
[00:07:01 - 00:07:06] So we have to be very careful how we move because it's a perfect place for an ambush.
[00:07:06 - 00:07:12] It's going to be a long night.
[00:07:12 - 00:07:15] And when we were going into the city with them, you know, you're sort of embedded with
[00:07:15 - 00:07:19] them, you sleep with them, you eat with them, you ride around in their battered, bullet-ridden
[00:07:19 - 00:07:24] armoured Humvees.
[00:07:24 - 00:07:28] We are here to bring peace and security inside Mosul and defeat ISIS.
[00:07:28 - 00:07:34] There are two forces at work here, good and evil.
[00:07:35 - 00:07:37] The world is divided in this way.
[00:07:37 - 00:07:43] And we would go into these communities for the first time and it was amazing to see the
[00:07:43 - 00:07:47] shock on people's faces, there's suddenly this white Western journalist there.
[00:07:47 - 00:07:52] And they had very much lost contact with the outside world, really, while ISIS was sort
[00:07:52 - 00:07:54] of dominating their environment.
[00:07:54 - 00:07:59] So if we fast forward a few years from that time period, President Trump was in office,
[00:07:59 - 00:08:00] it was his first term.
[00:08:00 - 00:08:04] I've been president for almost two years and we've really stepped it up.
[00:08:04 - 00:08:07] And we have won against ISIS.
[00:08:07 - 00:08:14] And I remember rather clearly when President Trump at the time announced that the US had
[00:08:14 - 00:08:15] beaten ISIS.
[00:08:15 - 00:08:23] So our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back and they're coming back now.
[00:08:23 - 00:08:24] We won.
[00:08:24 - 00:08:26] And that's the way we want it.
[00:08:26 - 00:08:28] And that's the way they want it.
[00:08:28 - 00:08:33] What happened to the remaining people who were living in this so-called caliphate, the
[00:08:33 - 00:08:35] fighters or family members?
[00:08:35 - 00:08:40] So, you know, if you imagine at the height of 2014, 2015, that's when the group is at
[00:08:40 - 00:08:41] the height of their power.
[00:08:41 - 00:08:43] They control a massive territory.
[00:08:43 - 00:08:50] Fast forward to 2019, that so-called state, if you will, has been pushed into less than
[00:08:50 - 00:08:53] a square kilometre in a town called Baghouz.
[00:08:53 - 00:09:00] Night after night, the assault from the air is relentless.
[00:09:00 - 00:09:03] And it is very heavily bombed, shelled, pounded.
[00:09:03 - 00:09:09] The sky above Baghouz coming alight as a coalition of nations seek to obliterate the darkness
[00:09:09 - 00:09:11] of Islamic State.
[00:09:11 - 00:09:16] And out of the ashes of that emerged tens of thousands of people.
[00:09:16 - 00:09:19] Their brutality has caused millions to leave their homes.
[00:09:19 - 00:09:22] Now they are the ones without a place to go.
[00:09:22 - 00:09:24] Nobody really knew what to do with them.
[00:09:24 - 00:09:27] These were people who had been associated with ISIS.
[00:09:27 - 00:09:30] Perhaps their family had taken them there or they'd been born inside it.
[00:09:30 - 00:09:35] Or they were card carrying members who had fought and, you know, had had family members
[00:09:35 - 00:09:37] die for the group.
[00:09:37 - 00:09:41] Now at that point, the women and children were put into sort of makeshift camps, if
[00:09:41 - 00:09:42] you will.
[00:09:42 - 00:09:46] And the men were put into quite horrific prisons.
[00:09:46 - 00:09:50] And sort of they've largely been there ever since.
[00:09:50 - 00:09:54] And there's been no universal global policy about what to do with these people.
[00:09:54 - 00:09:56] And today that's created a great tension.
[00:10:00 - 00:10:02] ♪
[00:10:02 - 00:10:05] Josh, you mentioned these camps
[00:10:05 - 00:10:07] for ISIS fighters and their family members.
[00:10:07 - 00:10:09] You've been to them, I understand.
[00:10:09 - 00:10:10] What's it like?
[00:10:11 - 00:10:12] Yeah, a lot, substantially.
[00:10:12 - 00:10:13] Really, what's it like?
[00:10:13 - 00:10:16] It differs depending on whether you're a man or a woman.
[00:10:16 - 00:10:20] And if you're a man, you tend to end up in these very,
[00:10:20 - 00:10:23] uh, grim prison facilities
[00:10:23 - 00:10:26] where you are completely shut off from the outside world.
[00:10:26 - 00:10:28] Um, for years, a lot of them weren't even sure
[00:10:28 - 00:10:31] whether the caliphate had truly ended.
[00:10:32 - 00:10:33] And so, they're a bit of a black box.
[00:10:34 - 00:10:36] For the women and their children,
[00:10:36 - 00:10:40] they tend to end up in these, uh, white-tinted,
[00:10:40 - 00:10:43] almost imagine refugee camps at the edge of the desert.
[00:10:44 - 00:10:45] They're very barren places,
[00:10:45 - 00:10:48] but they do have slightly more access to the outside world
[00:10:48 - 00:10:49] than the men do.
[00:10:50 - 00:10:51] And I have this very vivid memory, actually,
[00:10:51 - 00:10:55] of just after, uh, the fall of the caliphate,
[00:10:56 - 00:10:58] I had been talking over text
[00:10:58 - 00:11:00] with a number of these women in these camps.
[00:11:01 - 00:11:03] They had a phone that they would use in secret,
[00:11:03 - 00:11:05] and they would get together and ask me questions.
[00:11:05 - 00:11:07] And it was so fascinating and also hysterical,
[00:11:07 - 00:11:09] because the kind of questions they wanted to ask me was,
[00:11:09 - 00:11:11] -"What is Bitcoin?" -"Hmm."
[00:11:11 - 00:11:13] -"What is gender neutrality?" -"Hmm."
[00:11:13 - 00:11:16] -"Are gay men all good-looking?" -"Hmm."
[00:11:16 - 00:11:19] And there were all these concepts which are funny on face value,
[00:11:19 - 00:11:21] but it shows you how isolated they'd become
[00:11:22 - 00:11:23] and how they were wrestling with this world
[00:11:24 - 00:11:25] that they'd emerged back into.
[00:11:25 - 00:11:27] With these women you're referring to, Josh,
[00:11:27 - 00:11:29] were they Western women?
[00:11:29 - 00:11:32] Were they women who had grown up in Europe or the United States?
[00:11:32 - 00:11:34] Or are they from Iraq and Syria?
[00:11:34 - 00:11:37] There were a couple there that were from the region specifically,
[00:11:38 - 00:11:39] but predominantly, you know, they were Canadian,
[00:11:39 - 00:11:41] they were English, there was Dutch.
[00:11:41 - 00:11:42] Oh, wow.
[00:11:42 - 00:11:44] I think there was a German lady there at one point.
[00:11:44 - 00:11:47] There were women that had either traveled to be with the group
[00:11:47 - 00:11:48] with their families,
[00:11:48 - 00:11:50] or they were women that would argue
[00:11:50 - 00:11:52] that they were taken there against their will.
[00:11:52 - 00:11:55] How are these prisons managed?
[00:11:55 - 00:11:57] How secure are they?
[00:11:58 - 00:12:01] You describe a situation where there's kind of refugee tents, essentially.
[00:12:02 - 00:12:07] And is the vision that these tents slash prison camps
[00:12:07 - 00:12:09] will exist in perpetuity?
[00:12:09 - 00:12:13] Like, is there an eventual plan for what to do with these people?
[00:12:13 - 00:12:17] These facilities were always meant to be a temporary solution, right?
[00:12:18 - 00:12:22] And it's not just adults that live in these facilities,
[00:12:22 - 00:12:23] it's children as well.
[00:12:23 - 00:12:25] Some of these children were born inside the caliphate,
[00:12:25 - 00:12:28] some of them were taken there by their parents.
[00:12:28 - 00:12:32] And so they're surrounded by this sort of dominant ideology of extremism.
[00:12:33 - 00:12:34] And the longer they're kept there,
[00:12:34 - 00:12:37] security experts will tell you that the further they get
[00:12:37 - 00:12:40] from easy de-radicalization, if you will,
[00:12:40 - 00:12:42] because they don't know an outside world beyond that.
[00:12:43 - 00:12:46] They are, as I said, meant to be temporary facilities.
[00:12:46 - 00:12:48] Therefore, they are largely insecure.
[00:12:48 - 00:12:49] We do see prison breaks,
[00:12:49 - 00:12:53] we do see people paying to be smuggled out of these camps.
[00:12:54 - 00:12:58] ISIS themselves smuggle money into the camps as well.
[00:12:58 - 00:13:02] So the dominant sort of group inside are pro-ISIS supporters.
[00:13:02 - 00:13:06] There's one in particular called Al-Hol, which is this vast camp,
[00:13:06 - 00:13:11] which kind of seems like you've stepped into the set of Mad Max at times.
[00:13:11 - 00:13:15] To move about, you are essentially riding around in an armored vehicle
[00:13:15 - 00:13:18] with a massive machine gun on the top of it because it's so insecure.
[00:13:18 - 00:13:20] And that's just to move around inside.
[00:13:20 - 00:13:23] Hold up, Josh. You say ISIS is running the camp on the inside.
[00:13:24 - 00:13:25] What do you mean by that?
[00:13:25 - 00:13:27] So whether they would admit it to you or not,
[00:13:27 - 00:13:31] if you are a Syrian soldier at this moment
[00:13:31 - 00:13:34] and you wanted to walk into certain parts of this camp,
[00:13:34 - 00:13:36] you would be taking your life in your hands.
[00:13:36 - 00:13:39] I mean, when I was there a while ago, in one week,
[00:13:39 - 00:13:42] I think there were two people murdered inside this camp.
[00:13:42 - 00:13:45] They are camps where they have found makeshift weapons,
[00:13:45 - 00:13:46] knives, but also guns.
[00:13:46 - 00:13:50] It is very lawless in these parts of these camps.
[00:13:50 - 00:13:53] And how many people are you talking about inside one of these camps?
[00:13:53 - 00:13:55] I mean, it depends where you go.
[00:13:55 - 00:13:58] Conservative estimates would place it tens of thousands of people
[00:13:58 - 00:14:01] from as many as 52 nations still remain inside Syria.
[00:14:01 - 00:14:06] And there's a massive divergence about what we do with these people.
[00:14:06 - 00:14:08] Well, let's talk about that more, Josh.
[00:14:08 - 00:14:11] This issue of what to do with the people inside.
[00:14:11 - 00:14:14] There are so many, you're saying, foreign detainees
[00:14:14 - 00:14:15] inside some of these prisons.
[00:14:16 - 00:14:18] You mentioned 52 nations, I believe, a moment ago.
[00:14:18 - 00:14:23] So there's a massive difference here between what is politically acceptable
[00:14:23 - 00:14:26] and what security experts will tell you should happen.
[00:14:26 - 00:14:29] Nobody would dispute that these people pose a threat.
[00:14:29 - 00:14:33] But if our notion and our goal is security, this isn't a route to it.
[00:14:33 - 00:14:35] And security experts will tell you that.
[00:14:35 - 00:14:37] And here's where there's quite a big divergence.
[00:14:38 - 00:14:39] Hey!
[00:14:39 - 00:14:40] Hey, Sam, how are you?
[00:14:40 - 00:14:42] I'm doing OK, how are you?
[00:14:42 - 00:14:43] I'm good.
[00:14:43 - 00:14:46] I mean, I have a lot of questions.
[00:14:46 - 00:14:50] You know, America has been quite good at repatriations.
[00:14:50 - 00:14:53] I followed the story very closely of a lady called Sam Sally,
[00:14:53 - 00:14:54] which is our series one of our podcast,
[00:14:54 - 00:14:58] who is an American woman who says she was tricked into going to ISIS.
[00:14:58 - 00:15:02] So you knew in 2014 that Moussa wanted to join ISIS, categorically?
[00:15:02 - 00:15:05] Yes, I knew that he wanted to.
[00:15:05 - 00:15:07] I thought I had him talked out of it.
[00:15:08 - 00:15:11] I thought his family had him talked out of it as well.
[00:15:12 - 00:15:15] Then after that, although you think you've talked him out of it,
[00:15:15 - 00:15:18] you begin a process of smuggling tens of thousands of dollars
[00:15:18 - 00:15:22] of gold and cash out of the country to Hong Kong,
[00:15:22 - 00:15:24] making multiple trips.
[00:15:24 - 00:15:25] Yeah?
[00:15:25 - 00:15:26] Right. Yes.
[00:15:27 - 00:15:29] So you have supported terrorism then?
[00:15:30 - 00:15:31] Yeah.
[00:15:31 - 00:15:34] You know, America took her and her kids back,
[00:15:34 - 00:15:36] put her in prison, rehabilitated the kids.
[00:15:37 - 00:15:38] What's the best thing about being home?
[00:15:39 - 00:15:40] Everything.
[00:15:41 - 00:15:42] Just everything.
[00:15:42 - 00:15:44] Like, there isn't a best part.
[00:15:44 - 00:15:47] And they have had great success at doing that with her and others.
[00:15:48 - 00:15:49] Yeah, there isn't.
[00:15:49 - 00:15:51] It's just being here.
[00:15:52 - 00:15:53] It was nice.
[00:15:54 - 00:15:57] You know, I was texting with a former ISIS woman by the name of Noelle
[00:15:57 - 00:15:59] just before coming into this studio.
[00:15:59 - 00:16:00] She's back in Holland.
[00:16:00 - 00:16:02] She was brought back, put into prison.
[00:16:02 - 00:16:04] Her case went for review,
[00:16:04 - 00:16:08] and it was found that she was likely a victim of a coercive relationship,
[00:16:08 - 00:16:10] and the charges against her were dropped.
[00:16:10 - 00:16:11] And she's now back with her kids.
[00:16:12 - 00:16:13] Then there's England.
[00:16:13 - 00:16:18] And England has brought back some people quietly,
[00:16:18 - 00:16:20] often children and women.
[00:16:20 - 00:16:23] But predominantly, what the view has been
[00:16:23 - 00:16:25] is that we leave them in Syria.
[00:16:25 - 00:16:27] Where this gets interesting
[00:16:27 - 00:16:30] is that is the status quo that's been maintained to now.
[00:16:30 - 00:16:31] Mm-hmm.
[00:16:31 - 00:16:33] But in just the last few weeks,
[00:16:34 - 00:16:37] Damascus, under President al-Shara,
[00:16:37 - 00:16:40] has been trying to reconcile the country
[00:16:40 - 00:16:43] after, you know, more than a decade of civil war.
[00:16:43 - 00:16:44] Mm-hmm.
[00:16:44 - 00:16:47] And I think when that happens,
[00:16:47 - 00:16:51] Syria will move towards a position of asking nations
[00:16:51 - 00:16:54] to take their former citizens home.
[00:16:54 - 00:16:55] And at that point,
[00:16:56 - 00:16:59] it becomes a very difficult and unpalatable thing
[00:16:59 - 00:17:02] to think about what politicians in this country are going to do,
[00:17:02 - 00:17:03] and indeed, around the world.
[00:17:03 - 00:17:05] What's really interesting about Donald Trump
[00:17:06 - 00:17:09] is on this issue, he has been consistent, largely,
[00:17:09 - 00:17:13] in telling nations to take their former citizens home.
[00:17:13 - 00:17:16] That's such a curiosity to hear, Josh,
[00:17:16 - 00:17:17] because here on the domestic front,
[00:17:18 - 00:17:20] we hear President Trump talk about
[00:17:20 - 00:17:23] possible denaturalization of U.S. citizens.
[00:17:23 - 00:17:26] And there's been so much unrest and turmoil,
[00:17:26 - 00:17:29] as I'm sure you're familiar with, around issues of migration.
[00:17:29 - 00:17:31] And it's really striking to hear you say
[00:17:31 - 00:17:33] that he's putting pressure on other countries
[00:17:33 - 00:17:37] to repatriate some of these people in the ISIS prison camps.
[00:17:38 - 00:17:40] Certainly, within his first term, it was a major issue for him,
[00:17:40 - 00:17:44] in some respects, when it came to maintaining troops in Syria.
[00:17:44 - 00:17:47] He did not want to continue to have troops in Syria.
[00:17:48 - 00:17:50] At one point, he pulled a number of them out.
[00:17:50 - 00:17:52] And while these camps exist,
[00:17:52 - 00:17:56] there is some need for the U.S. to have a military presence there.
[00:18:01 - 00:18:05] Josh, you mentioned that while these camps are operating,
[00:18:05 - 00:18:08] there's a need for a U.S. military presence.
[00:18:08 - 00:18:11] And earlier, you spoke about pro-ISIS supporters
[00:18:11 - 00:18:14] almost kind of running amok in some of these camps.
[00:18:15 - 00:18:18] Can you just talk me through who runs these camps
[00:18:18 - 00:18:20] and why the United States is involved?
[00:18:20 - 00:18:22] Yeah, so let me back up for a minute,
[00:18:22 - 00:18:25] because I'm conscious that it can be a very, like, tangled picture
[00:18:25 - 00:18:26] if you're new to the subject.
[00:18:26 - 00:18:30] So, you know, I'm not a big fan of the idea of a military presence,
[00:18:30 - 00:18:32] but I'm not a big fan of the idea of a military presence.
[00:18:33 - 00:18:36] And I think that's a very important issue to the subject.
[00:18:36 - 00:18:39] So, when ISIS's caliphate emerged,
[00:18:39 - 00:18:42] Syria was in a state of civil war.
[00:18:42 - 00:18:45] It was governed by the dictator, Bashar al-Assad.
[00:18:45 - 00:18:50] And it wasn't until 2019
[00:18:50 - 00:18:53] that that so-called ISIS caliphate was defeated.
[00:18:53 - 00:18:55] And the way that that was done was,
[00:18:55 - 00:18:58] the U.S. government basically didn't want to put a lot of boots on the ground,
[00:18:58 - 00:19:01] and that militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces
[00:19:01 - 00:19:04] was made up of predominantly Kurds, but also Arabs as well.
[00:19:04 - 00:19:08] And they were very much our boots on the ground in the fight against ISIS.
[00:19:08 - 00:19:12] They defeated the caliphate for us, with assistance from us,
[00:19:12 - 00:19:13] but they defeated the caliphate for us.
[00:19:13 - 00:19:18] And when you say us, Josh, you mean the global coalition to defeat ISIS?
[00:19:18 - 00:19:22] Exactly. You know, every nation that sort of felt
[00:19:22 - 00:19:24] that this terrorist state could no longer exist.
[00:19:25 - 00:19:28] And in the aftermath of that, they kind of became, if you will,
[00:19:28 - 00:19:31] the world's jailers for members of ISIS.
[00:19:32 - 00:19:35] And the U.S. and the U.K. and others, to some degree,
[00:19:35 - 00:19:39] provided nominal support to the Syrian Democratic Forces
[00:19:39 - 00:19:41] to maintain that situation.
[00:19:41 - 00:19:44] Now, fast forward to December 2024,
[00:19:44 - 00:19:49] and the now-president al-Shara topples Assad,
[00:19:49 - 00:19:51] and he takes control.
[00:19:51 - 00:19:56] And one of the key things that he's been trying to do is unify the country.
[00:19:56 - 00:20:00] And part of that unification process involves the areas that had been controlled...
[00:20:00 - 00:20:05] the Syrian Democratic Forces, predominantly Kurdish group, humming under his control.
[00:20:08 - 00:20:13] The fighting between the Syrian army and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Aleppo
[00:20:13 - 00:20:18] has killed six people and injured 19 others. Up until recently the Kurdish-led SDF controlled
[00:20:18 - 00:20:24] about a quarter of the country in the northeast but over the last week that has shrunk considerably
[00:20:24 - 00:20:28] as government forces have advanced. The Syrian government and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic
[00:20:28 - 00:20:34] Forces say they've agreed to a comprehensive ceasefire deal. And what's happened in recent
[00:20:34 - 00:20:42] weeks is the American government who longed backed the Syrian Democratic Forces basically
[00:20:42 - 00:20:49] turned around and said this agreement has now expired and the most important thing for the
[00:20:49 - 00:20:56] future of Syria is a united Syria and they've very much shifted their focus now to supporting
[00:20:56 - 00:21:00] Damascus and it's interesting because even if you if you look at say Lindsey Graham. South
[00:21:00 - 00:21:06] Carolina Republican senator, yeah. Exactly, you know, he came out and he said you know we probably
[00:21:06 - 00:21:12] owe the Kurds something. The idea that we would abandon them and let the new Syrian government
[00:21:12 - 00:21:18] run by al-Shira, the former al-Qaeda guy, would destroy American credibility for generations.
[00:21:19 - 00:21:23] I don't believe President Trump's going to let that happen. That's striking because he's quite
[00:21:23 - 00:21:28] a loyal ally of President Trump. Completely. They helped us, they fought for us, we need to have
[00:21:28 - 00:21:35] their backs. What we've got here is we've got a question of honor and loyalty, right? And America
[00:21:35 - 00:21:40] is a society that recognizes the value of military might and so on so forth and I think there's a
[00:21:40 - 00:21:45] sense that the Kurds fought for us and we shouldn't abandon them amongst some Republican
[00:21:45 - 00:21:51] lawmakers and so on so forth. What does this actually mean for the security and the governance
[00:21:52 - 00:21:56] of the camps on the grounds and does it mean that ISIS has the potential to re-strengthen?
[00:21:56 - 00:22:02] In terms of the security situation around ISIS, since the fall of President Assad in December of
[00:22:02 - 00:22:09] 2024, ISIS was able to move around the country much more freely. Before that they'd very much
[00:22:09 - 00:22:13] been confined to certain areas. The American special forces would go in on these targeted
[00:22:13 - 00:22:20] missions or drop bombs but after the fall they started moving about the country and since then
[00:22:20 - 00:22:24] there have been attacks and from these prisons that we're talking about there have also been
[00:22:24 - 00:22:31] escapes. So one of the things that America has done very recently, it's enacted a policy of
[00:22:31 - 00:22:37] going into Syria and trying to remove some of these detainees from certain facilities and bring
[00:22:37 - 00:22:42] them actually into a secret place in Iraq because they feel that moving them into Iraq is safer at
[00:22:42 - 00:22:47] this moment than leaving them inside Syria. Josh, I feel like I now have a clearer sense
[00:22:47 - 00:22:53] of the dynamic in the camps and the security situation but I want us to zoom out a bit to
[00:22:53 - 00:23:00] the state of ISIS more broadly outside the camps. The United States has maintained a minimal troop
[00:23:00 - 00:23:06] presence on the ground in Syria and in December there was news of an ambush on U.S. forces.
[00:23:07 - 00:23:15] What exactly happened? Yeah, at that point very sadly two U.S. soldiers and a civilian interpreter
[00:23:15 - 00:23:21] were killed in an ISIS attack. The gunman is believed to be an ISIS operative who infiltrated
[00:23:21 - 00:23:28] a local security force. He was killed after forces engaged. And Donald Trump had an extraordinarily
[00:23:28 - 00:23:34] strong response to that. We hit the ISIS thugs in Syria who were trying to regroup after their
[00:23:34 - 00:23:42] decimation by the Trump administration five years ago. We hit them hard. I ordered a massive strike
[00:23:42 - 00:23:49] on the terrorists that killed our three great patriots last week. In that response that the
[00:23:49 - 00:23:56] Trump administration had to the ambush in December we have seen a number of strikes and I'm just
[00:23:56 - 00:24:01] gonna pull this up here but it seems like whenever the strikes are conducted we'll get a notification
[00:24:01 - 00:24:06] from U.S. Central Command. You know this one says that more than a hundred ISIS infrastructure
[00:24:06 - 00:24:12] targets were hit and that has me wondering well what exactly is an ISIS infrastructure target
[00:24:12 - 00:24:16] especially if there's no geographic site what are they referring to? So what they're commonly
[00:24:16 - 00:24:23] referring to when they say that is basically a cave or a hole somewhere in the desert where
[00:24:23 - 00:24:30] there might be a weapons cache or there might be people in hiding and a lot of those targets I'm
[00:24:30 - 00:24:36] sure are legitimate but also every now and again you know that again when I was in Syria recently
[00:24:36 - 00:24:42] people were joking with me about how America had blown up another cave. What the U.S. did in those
[00:24:42 - 00:24:49] strikes is you know they essentially used a mallet to try to degrade this group. They did a very
[00:24:49 - 00:24:54] targeted strike campaign but over a vast area and within that you are hitting these sort of very
[00:24:54 - 00:25:00] small hidden sites in attempt to degrade ISIS as well as targeting their leadership as well. What
[00:25:00 - 00:25:05] has been consistent is the U.S. has gone in and tried to target anyone who is senior leadership
[00:25:05 - 00:25:10] of ISIS to continue to degrade the group and it's that old cliche of cut off the the head and the
[00:25:10 - 00:25:16] body will die and by maintaining that it has been extraordinarily hard for ISIS to get back to
[00:25:16 - 00:25:22] anywhere near where it was. But that leads me to my central question which is does ISIS remain
[00:25:22 - 00:25:29] a real threat in Syria and if not in Syria does it remain a real threat in some other capacity?
[00:25:29 - 00:25:34] So if you imagine the current picture of ISIS looks something like this it breaks down into a
[00:25:34 - 00:25:41] number of issues. There is an insurgency that has to be contained and that's contained largely
[00:25:41 - 00:25:47] through airstrikes and targeted killings of its leadership. There are tens of thousands of
[00:25:47 - 00:25:54] prisoners from when that group had its so-called state where there is no coherent strategy of what
[00:25:54 - 00:26:01] to do with them and then there is the group's footholds overseas and I think this is the thing
[00:26:01 - 00:26:07] to think about it's like while the so-called state is gone there isn't a physical nation
[00:26:07 - 00:26:15] that people can go and join anymore the group's ability to inflict harm isn't. It causes a lot
[00:26:15 - 00:26:21] of issues on the continent of Africa. A brutal massacre at a church in Africa over the weekend.
[00:26:21 - 00:26:25] It causes issues in Afghanistan. A blast in Kabul has killed at least seven people
[00:26:25 - 00:26:30] and wounded more than a dozen others. It inspires attacks around the world. It would appear
[00:26:30 - 00:26:37] that there is evidence that this was inspired by a terrorist organisation by ISIS. Not at the scale
[00:26:37 - 00:26:43] it once did but that threat is still there and I think herein lies the problem while the caliphate
[00:26:43 - 00:26:50] is gone these small issues remain but if these issues aren't dealt with they can become a much
[00:26:50 - 00:26:59] bigger pain for the world to deal with. On that note thank you so much for your time Josh.
