00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey there, I'm Asma Khalid.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
And I'm Tristan Redman, and we're here with a bonus episode for you from the Global

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,240
Story podcast.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,280
The world order is shifting.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,400
Old alliances are fraying and new ones are emerging.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,600
Some of this turbulence can be traced to decisions made in the United States.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,800
But the US isn't just a cause of the upheaval.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,080
Its politics are also a symptom of it.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,400
Every day we focus on one story, looking at how America and the world shape each other.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,760
So we hope you enjoy this episode, and to find more of our show, just search for The

Global Story wherever you get your BBC podcasts.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,600
In the past few weeks, the US military has launched a steady stream of airstrikes in

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Syria.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,440
US officials say they're targeting the group known as the Islamic State, ISIS.

15
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,720
In part, it's retaliation for an attack on US forces in the region last December.

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,520
After a year of war, Pete Hegseth calls new airstrikes tonight in Syria a declaration

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,280
of vengeance against ISIS terrorists.

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,140
The US military has struck more than 50 ISIS targets in the past two hours.

19
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:16,440
We hit every site flawlessly, and we are restoring peace through strength all over the world.

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,480
These strikes also come against the backdrop of a recent jailbreak in which more than a

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,180
hundred militants escaped from a prison in Syria, raising fresh questions about the security

22
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,960
and fate of ISIS detainees.

23
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,160
And so now the US military is in the midst of transferring up to 7,000 prisoners from

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,420
Syria to Iraq because of instability and infighting.

25
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,880
From the BBC, I'm Asma Khalid in Washington, DC.

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,560
And today on The Global Story, is the Islamic State group having a resurgence in Syria?

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,480
Well, Josh, it's wonderful to have you on the show.

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,800
I'm a big fan of your work.

29
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
So thanks for joining us.

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
I appreciate the compliment.

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
You can send me an invoice for that later.

32
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,120
Well, can I have you introduce yourself for those who may not be familiar with who you

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,840
are and what you do?

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,520
So I'm an investigative journalist, filmmaker and podcaster, and I've sort of reported

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,600
on ISIS predominantly since the emergence of the group right through to present day.

36
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,160
I was even injured by the group in a suicide bombing back in 2016.

37
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,760
Josh, I know you have created these epic series about ISIS.

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,760
You've done a lot of reporting in the last decade or so when this group was at its height

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,680
in Syria and Iraq.

40
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,320
And the reason I wanted to have you on our show today is because for the last several

41
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,000
weeks, I have been getting these email notifications in my inbox from US Central Command talking

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,880
about strikes on ISIS targets in Syria.

43
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,760
And I had this moment of, well, wait a second, you know, what's going on here?

44
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,200
Because President Trump, during his first term in the White House, had said that ISIS

45
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,760
was defeated.

46
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,840
And I want to begin with a sort of broad, big picture question, which is, why are we

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,560
talking about ISIS again?

48
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,400
So I think the thing to think about ISIS is that they disappeared from the news cycle,

49
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
right?

50
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,640
And everyone kind of forgot about them.

51
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,400
But on the ground, they were always still there.

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
Now, granted, that wasn't at the scale that they once was.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,400
But they never really went away.

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,520
And I think, you know, I was just in Damascus, actually, very recently, and one of my last

55
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,240
nights there, I was having this dinner with a group of Syrian friends.

56
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,040
And while we were there, people's phones started buzzing.

57
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,720
And that was because a suicide bombing had gone off.

58
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,000
And at that point, I remember watching my friends' faces, and they were like, huh, the

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,320
insurgency has started.

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,240
And I think this is the key thing.

61
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,720
While they disappeared from the headlines, they didn't actually disappear on the ground.

62
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,600
Before we get any further into this conversation, I just want to pause for a moment and talk

63
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,920
about terminology.

64
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,360
You've heard me refer to the group here as ISIS.

65
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,900
Some listeners may know it as IS, or the so-called Islamic State.

66
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,940
And the terminology can be a little confusing here, because the group has been described

67
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,100
under different names.

68
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:15,900
But regardless of the name, I think it is worth rewinding to 2014.

69
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,700
And I think that's the moment when, here in the United States, ISIS really penetrated

70
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,740
into the public consciousness.

71
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,940
It's the year that President Obama announced the global coalition to defeat ISIS.

72
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,500
It was also the year that the American journalist James Foley was executed.

73
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,820
And at that time, Josh, what was the group selling?

74
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,020
So let's just rewind for a moment, because when we think about terrorist groups, we tend

75
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,300
to think of small entities running around, creating havoc.

76
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,980
And actually, what was unique about ISIS is that they actually formed a so-called state,

77
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,580
their caliphate, as they called it, if you will.

78
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,820
And people sometimes forget this when we talk about this group, is at the height of their

79
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:03,900
power, they actually controlled an area the size of England, right, that spanned Iraq

80
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,900
and Syria.

81
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,940
And it had roughly 10 million people under their governance.

82
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:16,260
And what they did then is they set about a really highly polished PR and propaganda campaign

83
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:23,620
of selling this vision to the world of a supposed Islamic utopia, and inviting people from all

84
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,740
around the world to come and join them.

85
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,780
And tens of thousands of people did from more than 100 nations.

86
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,980
And from there, the state grew and grew and grew.

87
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:40,500
But a lot of people felt like this was not a representation of Islam at all.

88
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,180
Yeah, I mean, and just to be transparent with listeners, I mean, I'm a Muslim woman, I have

89
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,940
a master's in Middle Eastern Islamic Studies, I've studied the faith quite a bit.

90
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:56,180
And what they were selling was such a distortion of the religion and seemed so disconnected

91
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:03,580
from reality, that it is mind boggling to me that it was in any ways sold as a utopia.

92
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:10,660
During the height of the ISIS caliphate days, Josh, I know you reported from the region.

93
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,220
What was it like to report from the region at that time?

94
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:20,340
It was an extraordinary time because you had a scenario where literally the map of

95
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,300
two countries had been redrawn by this terrorist organisation.

96
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,460
And you had a concerted effort to defeat them going on.

97
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:34,580
So being inside the territory that they controlled, or the fight to regain that territory was

98
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,580
extraordinarily dangerous.

99
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,100
We're in an armoured car pulling back from one of the forward positions.

100
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:48,700
The roads are literally littered with debris, with cars.

101
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,820
I remember there was one time when I was in Iraq, I was embedded with Iraqi special forces

102
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,460
and they were trying to retake the city of Mosul, which is where ISIS had declared its

103
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,180
so-called caliphate from.

104
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,380
So we have to be very careful how we move because it's a perfect place for an ambush.

105
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,580
It's going to be a long night.

106
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,300
And when we were going into the city with them, you know, you're sort of embedded with

107
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,260
them, you sleep with them, you eat with them, you ride around in their battered, bullet-ridden

108
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,980
armoured Humvees.

109
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,460
We are here to bring peace and security inside Mosul and defeat ISIS.

110
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,220
There are two forces at work here, good and evil.

111
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,700
The world is divided in this way.

112
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:42,740
And we would go into these communities for the first time and it was amazing to see the

113
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,820
shock on people's faces, there's suddenly this white Western journalist there.

114
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,740
And they had very much lost contact with the outside world, really, while ISIS was sort

115
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,860
of dominating their environment.

116
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:59,020
So if we fast forward a few years from that time period, President Trump was in office,

117
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,180
it was his first term.

118
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,500
I've been president for almost two years and we've really stepped it up.

119
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,260
And we have won against ISIS.

120
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,860
And I remember rather clearly when President Trump at the time announced that the US had

121
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,340
beaten ISIS.

122
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:22,860
So our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back and they're coming back now.

123
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,900
We won.

124
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,540
And that's the way we want it.

125
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,260
And that's the way they want it.

126
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:33,060
What happened to the remaining people who were living in this so-called caliphate, the

127
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:34,940
fighters or family members?

128
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,940
So, you know, if you imagine at the height of 2014, 2015, that's when the group is at

129
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,940
the height of their power.

130
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,780
They control a massive territory.

131
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:49,940
Fast forward to 2019, that so-called state, if you will, has been pushed into less than

132
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,180
a square kilometre in a town called Baghouz.

133
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,940
Night after night, the assault from the air is relentless.

134
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,380
And it is very heavily bombed, shelled, pounded.

135
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:09,300
The sky above Baghouz coming alight as a coalition of nations seek to obliterate the darkness

136
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,300
of Islamic State.

137
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,860
And out of the ashes of that emerged tens of thousands of people.

138
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,940
Their brutality has caused millions to leave their homes.

139
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,060
Now they are the ones without a place to go.

140
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,320
Nobody really knew what to do with them.

141
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,100
These were people who had been associated with ISIS.

142
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,340
Perhaps their family had taken them there or they'd been born inside it.

143
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,020
Or they were card carrying members who had fought and, you know, had had family members

144
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,700
die for the group.

145
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:41,340
Now at that point, the women and children were put into sort of makeshift camps, if

146
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,340
you will.

147
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,700
And the men were put into quite horrific prisons.

148
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,500
And sort of they've largely been there ever since.

149
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,740
And there's been no universal global policy about what to do with these people.

150
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,060
And today that's created a great tension.

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,960
♪

152
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,540
Josh, you mentioned these camps

153
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,140
for ISIS fighters and their family members.

154
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,380
You've been to them, I understand.

155
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,460
What's it like?

156
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,880
Yeah, a lot, substantially.

157
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,220
Really, what's it like?

158
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,920
It differs depending on whether you're a man or a woman.

159
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,020
And if you're a man, you tend to end up in these very,

160
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,020
uh, grim prison facilities

161
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,140
where you are completely shut off from the outside world.

162
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,360
Um, for years, a lot of them weren't even sure

163
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,180
whether the caliphate had truly ended.

164
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,480
And so, they're a bit of a black box.

165
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,180
For the women and their children,

166
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,980
they tend to end up in these, uh, white-tinted,

167
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,240
almost imagine refugee camps at the edge of the desert.

168
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,940
They're very barren places,

169
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,280
but they do have slightly more access to the outside world

170
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
than the men do.

171
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,240
And I have this very vivid memory, actually,

172
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,460
of just after, uh, the fall of the caliphate,

173
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
I had been talking over text

174
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,440
with a number of these women in these camps.

175
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,780
They had a phone that they would use in secret,

176
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,820
and they would get together and ask me questions.

177
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,980
And it was so fascinating and also hysterical,

178
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,320
because the kind of questions they wanted to ask me was,

179
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,040
-"What is Bitcoin?" -"Hmm."

180
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,320
-"What is gender neutrality?" -"Hmm."

181
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,160
-"Are gay men all good-looking?" -"Hmm."

182
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,920
And there were all these concepts which are funny on face value,

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,420
but it shows you how isolated they'd become

184
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,420
and how they were wrestling with this world

185
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,000
that they'd emerged back into.

186
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,220
With these women you're referring to, Josh,

187
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,960
were they Western women?

188
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,180
Were they women who had grown up in Europe or the United States?

189
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,140
Or are they from Iraq and Syria?

190
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,440
There were a couple there that were from the region specifically,

191
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,220
but predominantly, you know, they were Canadian,

192
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,900
they were English, there was Dutch.

193
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,980
Oh, wow.

194
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,060
I think there was a German lady there at one point.

195
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,700
There were women that had either traveled to be with the group

196
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,780
with their families,

197
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,280
or they were women that would argue

198
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,280
that they were taken there against their will.

199
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,240
How are these prisons managed?

200
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,440
How secure are they?

201
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,120
You describe a situation where there's kind of refugee tents, essentially.

202
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,280
And is the vision that these tents slash prison camps

203
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,340
will exist in perpetuity?

204
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,880
Like, is there an eventual plan for what to do with these people?

205
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,460
These facilities were always meant to be a temporary solution, right?

206
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,640
And it's not just adults that live in these facilities,

207
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,000
it's children as well.

208
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Some of these children were born inside the caliphate,

209
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,120
some of them were taken there by their parents.

210
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,420
And so they're surrounded by this sort of dominant ideology of extremism.

211
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,960
And the longer they're kept there,

212
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,920
security experts will tell you that the further they get

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,560
from easy de-radicalization, if you will,

214
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,440
because they don't know an outside world beyond that.

215
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,720
They are, as I said, meant to be temporary facilities.

216
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,900
Therefore, they are largely insecure.

217
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,320
We do see prison breaks,

218
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,160
we do see people paying to be smuggled out of these camps.

219
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,580
ISIS themselves smuggle money into the camps as well.

220
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,500
So the dominant sort of group inside are pro-ISIS supporters.

221
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,840
There's one in particular called Al-Hol, which is this vast camp,

222
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,640
which kind of seems like you've stepped into the set of Mad Max at times.

223
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,680
To move about, you are essentially riding around in an armored vehicle

224
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,320
with a massive machine gun on the top of it because it's so insecure.

225
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,360
And that's just to move around inside.

226
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,400
Hold up, Josh. You say ISIS is running the camp on the inside.

227
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,980
What do you mean by that?

228
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,280
So whether they would admit it to you or not,

229
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,700
if you are a Syrian soldier at this moment

230
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,580
and you wanted to walk into certain parts of this camp,

231
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,820
you would be taking your life in your hands.

232
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,820
I mean, when I was there a while ago, in one week,

233
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,620
I think there were two people murdered inside this camp.

234
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
They are camps where they have found makeshift weapons,

235
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,380
knives, but also guns.

236
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,520
It is very lawless in these parts of these camps.

237
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,320
And how many people are you talking about inside one of these camps?

238
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,780
I mean, it depends where you go.

239
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,620
Conservative estimates would place it tens of thousands of people

240
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,740
from as many as 52 nations still remain inside Syria.

241
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,240
And there's a massive divergence about what we do with these people.

242
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,840
Well, let's talk about that more, Josh.

243
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,840
This issue of what to do with the people inside.

244
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,920
There are so many, you're saying, foreign detainees

245
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,420
inside some of these prisons.

246
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,020
You mentioned 52 nations, I believe, a moment ago.

247
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,720
So there's a massive difference here between what is politically acceptable

248
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,720
and what security experts will tell you should happen.

249
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,680
Nobody would dispute that these people pose a threat.

250
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,820
But if our notion and our goal is security, this isn't a route to it.

251
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,560
And security experts will tell you that.

252
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,120
And here's where there's quite a big divergence.

253
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
Hey!

254
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,160
Hey, Sam, how are you?

255
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,780
I'm doing OK, how are you?

256
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
I'm good.

257
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,020
I mean, I have a lot of questions.

258
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,700
You know, America has been quite good at repatriations.

259
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,660
I followed the story very closely of a lady called Sam Sally,

260
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,400
which is our series one of our podcast,

261
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,780
who is an American woman who says she was tricked into going to ISIS.

262
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,200
So you knew in 2014 that Moussa wanted to join ISIS, categorically?

263
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,620
Yes, I knew that he wanted to.

264
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,120
I thought I had him talked out of it.

265
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,000
I thought his family had him talked out of it as well.

266
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,820
Then after that, although you think you've talked him out of it,

267
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,400
you begin a process of smuggling tens of thousands of dollars

268
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,740
of gold and cash out of the country to Hong Kong,

269
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,620
making multiple trips.

270
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Yeah?

271
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Right. Yes.

272
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,200
So you have supported terrorism then?

273
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,380
Yeah.

274
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,760
You know, America took her and her kids back,

275
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,960
put her in prison, rehabilitated the kids.

276
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,500
What's the best thing about being home?

277
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Everything.

278
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,300
Just everything.

279
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,880
Like, there isn't a best part.

280
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,180
And they have had great success at doing that with her and others.

281
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,220
Yeah, there isn't.

282
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,680
It's just being here.

283
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,840
It was nice.

284
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,060
You know, I was texting with a former ISIS woman by the name of Noelle

285
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,720
just before coming into this studio.

286
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,140
She's back in Holland.

287
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,980
She was brought back, put into prison.

288
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,980
Her case went for review,

289
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,100
and it was found that she was likely a victim of a coercive relationship,

290
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,900
and the charges against her were dropped.

291
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,380
And she's now back with her kids.

292
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,100
Then there's England.

293
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,060
And England has brought back some people quietly,

294
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,220
often children and women.

295
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,780
But predominantly, what the view has been

296
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,560
is that we leave them in Syria.

297
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,940
Where this gets interesting

298
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,620
is that is the status quo that's been maintained to now.

299
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,700
Mm-hmm.

300
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,820
But in just the last few weeks,

301
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,660
Damascus, under President al-Shara,

302
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,880
has been trying to reconcile the country

303
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,060
after, you know, more than a decade of civil war.

304
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,180
Mm-hmm.

305
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,760
And I think when that happens,

306
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,560
Syria will move towards a position of asking nations

307
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,140
to take their former citizens home.

308
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,440
And at that point,

309
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,360
it becomes a very difficult and unpalatable thing

310
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,700
to think about what politicians in this country are going to do,

311
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,900
and indeed, around the world.

312
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,440
What's really interesting about Donald Trump

313
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,200
is on this issue, he has been consistent, largely,

314
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,580
in telling nations to take their former citizens home.

315
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,500
That's such a curiosity to hear, Josh,

316
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,460
because here on the domestic front,

317
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,580
we hear President Trump talk about

318
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,580
possible denaturalization of U.S. citizens.

319
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,580
And there's been so much unrest and turmoil,

320
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,880
as I'm sure you're familiar with, around issues of migration.

321
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,720
And it's really striking to hear you say

322
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,920
that he's putting pressure on other countries

323
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
to repatriate some of these people in the ISIS prison camps.

324
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,420
Certainly, within his first term, it was a major issue for him,

325
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,100
in some respects, when it came to maintaining troops in Syria.

326
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,440
He did not want to continue to have troops in Syria.

327
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,640
At one point, he pulled a number of them out.

328
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,320
And while these camps exist,

329
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,780
there is some need for the U.S. to have a military presence there.

330
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,740
Josh, you mentioned that while these camps are operating,

331
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,620
there's a need for a U.S. military presence.

332
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,920
And earlier, you spoke about pro-ISIS supporters

333
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,500
almost kind of running amok in some of these camps.

334
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,720
Can you just talk me through who runs these camps

335
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,760
and why the United States is involved?

336
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,800
Yeah, so let me back up for a minute,

337
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,840
because I'm conscious that it can be a very, like, tangled picture

338
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,220
if you're new to the subject.

339
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,680
So, you know, I'm not a big fan of the idea of a military presence,

340
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,440
but I'm not a big fan of the idea of a military presence.

341
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,560
And I think that's a very important issue to the subject.

342
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,240
So, when ISIS's caliphate emerged,

343
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,820
Syria was in a state of civil war.

344
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:45,120
It was governed by the dictator, Bashar al-Assad.

345
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,580
And it wasn't until 2019

346
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,580
that that so-called ISIS caliphate was defeated.

347
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,620
And the way that that was done was,

348
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,080
the U.S. government basically didn't want to put a lot of boots on the ground,

349
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,940
and that militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces

350
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,280
was made up of predominantly Kurds, but also Arabs as well.

351
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,040
And they were very much our boots on the ground in the fight against ISIS.

352
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,880
They defeated the caliphate for us, with assistance from us,

353
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,380
but they defeated the caliphate for us.

354
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,760
And when you say us, Josh, you mean the global coalition to defeat ISIS?

355
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,640
Exactly. You know, every nation that sort of felt

356
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,480
that this terrorist state could no longer exist.

357
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,900
And in the aftermath of that, they kind of became, if you will,

358
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,420
the world's jailers for members of ISIS.

359
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,020
And the U.S. and the U.K. and others, to some degree,

360
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,600
provided nominal support to the Syrian Democratic Forces

361
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,760
to maintain that situation.

362
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,280
Now, fast forward to December 2024,

363
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,900
and the now-president al-Shara topples Assad,

364
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,360
and he takes control.

365
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,620
And one of the key things that he's been trying to do is unify the country.

366
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,920
And part of that unification process involves the areas that had been controlled...

367
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,280
the Syrian Democratic Forces, predominantly Kurdish group, humming under his control.

368
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,800
The fighting between the Syrian army and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in Aleppo

369
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,080
has killed six people and injured 19 others. Up until recently the Kurdish-led SDF controlled

370
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,840
about a quarter of the country in the northeast but over the last week that has shrunk considerably

371
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,480
as government forces have advanced. The Syrian government and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic

372
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,400
Forces say they've agreed to a comprehensive ceasefire deal. And what's happened in recent

373
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:41,520
weeks is the American government who longed backed the Syrian Democratic Forces basically

374
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:49,040
turned around and said this agreement has now expired and the most important thing for the

375
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:56,080
future of Syria is a united Syria and they've very much shifted their focus now to supporting

376
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,480
Damascus and it's interesting because even if you if you look at say Lindsey Graham. South

377
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,680
Carolina Republican senator, yeah. Exactly, you know, he came out and he said you know we probably

378
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:11,520
owe the Kurds something. The idea that we would abandon them and let the new Syrian government

379
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,160
run by al-Shira, the former al-Qaeda guy, would destroy American credibility for generations.

380
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,720
I don't believe President Trump's going to let that happen. That's striking because he's quite

381
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,000
a loyal ally of President Trump. Completely. They helped us, they fought for us, we need to have

382
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,880
their backs. What we've got here is we've got a question of honor and loyalty, right? And America

383
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,080
is a society that recognizes the value of military might and so on so forth and I think there's a

384
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,720
sense that the Kurds fought for us and we shouldn't abandon them amongst some Republican

385
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,440
lawmakers and so on so forth. What does this actually mean for the security and the governance

386
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,160
of the camps on the grounds and does it mean that ISIS has the potential to re-strengthen?

387
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,840
In terms of the security situation around ISIS, since the fall of President Assad in December of

388
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,960
2024, ISIS was able to move around the country much more freely. Before that they'd very much

389
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,360
been confined to certain areas. The American special forces would go in on these targeted

390
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,680
missions or drop bombs but after the fall they started moving about the country and since then

391
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,160
there have been attacks and from these prisons that we're talking about there have also been

392
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:31,040
escapes. So one of the things that America has done very recently, it's enacted a policy of

393
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,880
going into Syria and trying to remove some of these detainees from certain facilities and bring

394
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,320
them actually into a secret place in Iraq because they feel that moving them into Iraq is safer at

395
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,800
this moment than leaving them inside Syria. Josh, I feel like I now have a clearer sense

396
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,640
of the dynamic in the camps and the security situation but I want us to zoom out a bit to

397
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:59,840
the state of ISIS more broadly outside the camps. The United States has maintained a minimal troop

398
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,320
presence on the ground in Syria and in December there was news of an ambush on U.S. forces.

399
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:14,960
What exactly happened? Yeah, at that point very sadly two U.S. soldiers and a civilian interpreter

400
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,280
were killed in an ISIS attack. The gunman is believed to be an ISIS operative who infiltrated

401
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:28,160
a local security force. He was killed after forces engaged. And Donald Trump had an extraordinarily

402
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,920
strong response to that. We hit the ISIS thugs in Syria who were trying to regroup after their

403
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:41,600
decimation by the Trump administration five years ago. We hit them hard. I ordered a massive strike

404
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:49,120
on the terrorists that killed our three great patriots last week. In that response that the

405
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:55,920
Trump administration had to the ambush in December we have seen a number of strikes and I'm just

406
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,960
gonna pull this up here but it seems like whenever the strikes are conducted we'll get a notification

407
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,400
from U.S. Central Command. You know this one says that more than a hundred ISIS infrastructure

408
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,680
targets were hit and that has me wondering well what exactly is an ISIS infrastructure target

409
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,320
especially if there's no geographic site what are they referring to? So what they're commonly

410
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:22,960
referring to when they say that is basically a cave or a hole somewhere in the desert where

411
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:30,320
there might be a weapons cache or there might be people in hiding and a lot of those targets I'm

412
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,240
sure are legitimate but also every now and again you know that again when I was in Syria recently

413
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,840
people were joking with me about how America had blown up another cave. What the U.S. did in those

414
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:48,800
strikes is you know they essentially used a mallet to try to degrade this group. They did a very

415
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:54,480
targeted strike campaign but over a vast area and within that you are hitting these sort of very

416
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,000
small hidden sites in attempt to degrade ISIS as well as targeting their leadership as well. What

417
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,440
has been consistent is the U.S. has gone in and tried to target anyone who is senior leadership

418
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,000
of ISIS to continue to degrade the group and it's that old cliche of cut off the the head and the

419
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,680
body will die and by maintaining that it has been extraordinarily hard for ISIS to get back to

420
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:21,600
anywhere near where it was. But that leads me to my central question which is does ISIS remain

421
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:29,120
a real threat in Syria and if not in Syria does it remain a real threat in some other capacity?

422
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,840
So if you imagine the current picture of ISIS looks something like this it breaks down into a

423
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:40,960
number of issues. There is an insurgency that has to be contained and that's contained largely

424
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,560
through airstrikes and targeted killings of its leadership. There are tens of thousands of

425
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:53,760
prisoners from when that group had its so-called state where there is no coherent strategy of what

426
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,560
to do with them and then there is the group's footholds overseas and I think this is the thing

427
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:06,880
to think about it's like while the so-called state is gone there isn't a physical nation

428
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:15,360
that people can go and join anymore the group's ability to inflict harm isn't. It causes a lot

429
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,640
of issues on the continent of Africa. A brutal massacre at a church in Africa over the weekend.

430
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,360
It causes issues in Afghanistan. A blast in Kabul has killed at least seven people

431
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,480
and wounded more than a dozen others. It inspires attacks around the world. It would appear

432
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:37,360
that there is evidence that this was inspired by a terrorist organisation by ISIS. Not at the scale

433
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,880
it once did but that threat is still there and I think herein lies the problem while the caliphate

434
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:50,000
is gone these small issues remain but if these issues aren't dealt with they can become a much

435
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:58,960
bigger pain for the world to deal with. On that note thank you so much for your time Josh.
