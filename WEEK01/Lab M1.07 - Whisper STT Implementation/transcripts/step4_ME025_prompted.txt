How do you go about making a small rowboat? We just make the small scale model and draft it from that. Make a keel out. You make a scale model first? Most everybody does, make a scale model. Or else they draft them out, draw them out on paper. Either one you want to, it doesn't matter. How big are these scale models? The general rule on small type boat is 3 quarter inch to a foot. The large ones are up to a quarter inch to a foot. And what's the purpose of the scale model? The length and the width and all this. Oh I see, they just use smaller everything and then they just scale them up and down. And then how do you go about deciding to build the boat itself? Well you make the keel first from the model, from the drafting, drawing, whatever it is. Then you make the stem and the stern. And for the small stuff, the small boats where you bend the frame, you make a mold, what we call a mold, there's sections of it, so far apart on the boat you take the shape of it, make sections. What do they use to do that? Plywood? Plywood or cedar, it doesn't matter.
