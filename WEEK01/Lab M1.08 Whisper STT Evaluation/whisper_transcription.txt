Skier Lindsey Vonn has undergone surgery on a left leg fracture after suffering heartbreak in what could be her final Olympic event as she crashed in the women's downhill competition in Cortina. The 41-year-old was competing just nine days after rupturing ligaments in her left knee, but hitting the gate with her ski pole on her first jump left Vonn off balance, denying a fairytale ending to a remarkable story. Vonn was airlifted off the piste to Ca' Foncello hospital in Treviso, around 130km from Olympia del Tofane in the Dolomites, following a lengthy treatment. The hospital issued a statement which said she had undergone orthopedic surgery to stabilize the fracture she had.
